Chinese version: `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`

This note is for collaborators who did not run the model. Read **Section 1 (glossary)** first, then look up files and column names.

In one sentence: for 111 neighbourhoods in Edinburgh, we use the past 7 days of the rolling seven-day infection rate to forecast the rolling seven-day rate **7 days ahead**, with uncertainty every day and an explanation for the last (unverified) day only.

---

## 1. Glossary (read this first)

### Geography

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **IZ** | Intermediate Zone, a Scottish neighbourhood unit. Edinburgh uses the **2011** geography: **111** zones. |
| **iz_code** | Zone code, e.g. `S02001576`. Maps, forecasts and explanations all join on this key. |
| **node_index** | The zone’s index in the model order, 0 to 110. Do not reorder. |

### What we forecast

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Rolling seven-day infection rate** | The published “last 7 days positive rate”, unit: **per 100,000**. This is **not** daily new cases. |
| **issue_date** | The last day the model is allowed to see. Think of it as “today”. |
| **target_report_date** | The day being forecast. Always **issue_date + 7 days**. |
| **observed_rate** | The rate that was later published for the target day. Needed to score accuracy. |
| **predicted_rate** | The model’s forecast for the target day. |

Example: if the issue date is 2023-02-18, the target date is 2023-02-25.  
The model uses rates from 12–18 February to forecast the rolling seven-day rate for 25 February.

### What U01 and U10 mean

The test period is about nine months. We do **not** train once and freeze the weights. We refit about every **28 days**. There are 10 updates:

**U01, U02, …, U10** = 1st update, 2nd update, …, 10th (final) update.

Treat them as “model versions”.

| ID | Issue dates it covers (approx.) | Plain language |
|---|---|---|
| U01 | 2022-05-31 to 2022-06-27 | First version in the test period |
| U02 | 2022-06-28 to 2022-07-25 | Second version |
| … | … | … |
| **U10** | Labelled retrospective use through 2023-02-18; the 4 March extrapolation also uses this version | **Last version** |

For a given day’s map, use **that day’s U0x**. Do not average all ten versions and then explain that day.

**checkpoint** = the saved weights for that version. In these tables `checkpoint_id` and `update_id` are the same label (U01–U10).

**Rolling** means this updating protocol **on the test set**, not on the training set. Train / validation dates are not in the website date list.

### Two kinds of date — do not mix them

| Type | What it is | Is there a published truth? | Can we score accuracy? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Retrospective** | 2022-06-07 to 2023-02-25, **264** target days | Yes | Yes. These are the paper metrics. |
| **Unverified extrapolation** | **2023-03-04 only** | **No**. The panel ends 25 February. | **No** MAE, R² or coverage |

4 March uses **U10** because 25 February still falls inside U10’s scheduled 28-day live window.

### How the forecast is built (intuition)

1. Start from today’s rate \(Y_t\).  
2. The model predicts only the **change** \(\Delta\) (how much higher or lower in 7 days).  
3. Forecast rate = today’s rate + change.  
4. **Persistence baseline**: pretend the rate in 7 days is still today’s rate. Used to ask whether the model beats “no change”.

### What alpha (α) is

The model mixes three relationship graphs:

- **alpha_geo**: whether zones are neighbours  
- **alpha_transport**: directed road / public-transport graph  
- **alpha_mobility**: commuting OD (not real-time flow)

The three numbers are **positive and sum to 1**. For U10 they are about 0.32 / 0.32 / 0.36.

**Correct:** “This version relies a little more on the mobility graph.”  
**Incorrect:** “Mobility explains 36% of cases / 36% of vaccination demand.”

Alpha is **not** a risk map and **not** an allocation weight.

### Uncertainty

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **predicted_sigma (σ)** | How unsure the model is. Larger = more uncertain. Maps should colour this continuously. |
| **80% / 95% interval** | “We think the truth probably lies in this band.” Calibrated bands are the ones to report, not the raw Gaussian bands. |
| **uncertainty_flag** | `high` if σ is above the **90th percentile of σ for that model version**; otherwise `normal`. Optional overlay, not required. |

Uncertainty exists for **every one of the 264 retrospective days**, and also for 4 March.  
4 March has no observation, so you can show “how unsure the model is” but you cannot check whether the interval covered the truth.

### What GeoShapley is

It answers: **for this zone’s forecast**, relative to a city-wide median baseline, which socio-economic variables push the forecast up or down?

- Not causal (do not say “poverty caused infections”)  
- Does not explain neural embedding dimensions  
- Different from alpha  
- **Currently computed only for 4 March, U10**. The 264 retrospective days have no GeoShapley (it was turned off during rolling to save compute). We do **not** recommend computing all 264 days; a few staged dates would be enough if needed.

### Accuracy metrics (paper tables)

| Metric | Plain meaning | Better when… |
|---|---|---|
| **MAE** | Average absolute miss (per 100,000) | Smaller. Rolling **46.53**, persistence **50.66** |
| **MAE skill** | How much better than persistence: `1 − model MAE / persistence MAE` | Positive = better than “no change”. Rolling **+0.081** (about 8% better) |
| **RMSE** | Also an error score; large misses are penalised more | Smaller |
| **R²** | Share of target-day variation explained vs predicting the mean | Closer to 1. Rolling **0.67** |
| **bias** | Average over- or under-prediction | Near 0. Positive = systematically too high |
| **coverage** | Share of truths that fall inside the forecast interval | Nominal 80% covers about 82% in the test set; nominal 95% about 95% |

These numbers come from **retrospective test days only**. They do **not** include 4 March.

```

Use `website/` for the webpage. Use `article/table01` … `table06` for the paper.

---

## 3. Each file: purpose, how it was made, column names

### 1) `website/retrospective_predictions.csv` (main retrospective table)

**One row:** one target day × one zone.  
**Rows:** 264 days × 111 zones = 29,304.  
**How:** forecast with that day’s model version (U01–U10). Published values exist, so errors can be computed.  
**Use:** after picking a date, draw predicted / observed / error / uncertainty maps; compare the model with persistence.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `issue_date` | Cut-off day (last day the model may see) |
| `target_report_date` | Day being forecast (issue_date + 7) |
| `update_id` | Which model version, U01–U10 |
| `checkpoint_id` | Same as `update_id` |
| `iz_code` | Zone code |
| `node_index` | Zone index 0–110 |
| `observed_rate` | True rolling seven-day rate on the target day |
| `anchor_rate_y_t` | True rate on the issue day (starting point) |
| `predicted_delta` | Predicted change over 7 days |
| `predicted_rate` | Forecast = starting point + change |
| `predicted_sigma` | Uncertainty (larger = less sure) |
| `calibrated80_lower` / `upper` | Calibrated ~80% interval |
| `calibrated95_lower` / `upper` | Calibrated ~95% interval |
| `uncertainty_flag` | `high` if unusually uncertain for that version; else `normal` |
| `persistence_prediction` | “Assume no change” forecast; equals the starting point |
| `model_error` | prediction − truth (positive = too high) |
| `model_absolute_error` | Absolute error (≥ 0) |
| `persistence_absolute_error` | Absolute error of “assume no change” |
| `alpha_geo` | Geographic-graph weight for this version |
| `alpha_transport` | Transport-graph weight |
| `alpha_mobility` | Mobility-graph weight |
| `node_order_hash` | Fingerprint of the 111-zone order |
| `forecast_status` | Always `retrospective_evaluation` (labelled test) |
| `observed_target_available` | Always true |

### 2) `website/future_forecast_20230304.csv` (4 March, unverified)

**One row:** one zone on 2023-03-04 (111 rows).  
**How:** the panel ends 25 February. **U10** reads 19–25 February and forecasts 4 March. No retraining.  
**Use:** a separate website day; if discussing “next-week vaccination sites”, use `predicted_rate` and σ from this file as the risk layer.  
**Missing:** truth and errors. Do not score accuracy.

Extra columns vs the retrospective file:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `predicted_variance` | σ squared |
| `include_in_metrics` | Always false: do not put this day in accuracy tables |
| `forecast_status` | `unverified_extrapolation` |
| `observed_rate` and all error columns | Empty: no published 4 March value |

### 3) `website/geoshapley.csv` (explanation, one day only)

**One row:** 4 March × one zone × one explanation component.  
**How:** change only that zone’s socio-economic variables and location, see how the forecast moves, then split the movement into parts.  
**Use:** click a zone to see what pushed the forecast up or down.  
**Missing:** the other 264 retrospective days.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `component` | `baseline` = city-median starting forecast; `main` = a variable on its own; `location` = location; `location_interaction` = location × variable |
| `feature_name` | Which variable; see table below |
| `shapley_value` | How much this part adds to the forecast rate (can be negative) |
| `predicted_rate` | Model forecast for that zone |
| `reconstructed_prediction` | Sum of parts; should match the forecast |
| `additivity_error` | Reconstruction gap (near 0 here) |
| `explanation_scope` | `target_iz_local`: this zone only |
| `alpha_*` | U10 graph weights (context, not Shapley values) |

`feature_name` labels:

| Name in the file | Plain meaning |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | Forecast if this zone sat at city-wide medians |
| `income_deprivation` | Income deprivation |
| `employment_deprivation` | Employment deprivation |
| `higher_education` | Higher education |
| `overcrowding` | Housing overcrowding |
| `crime` | Neighbourhood crime |
| `public_transport_time_to_gp` | Public-transport time to a GP |
| `location` | Geographic location (easting and northing together) |
| `location_x_income_deprivation` etc. | Extra location × variable term, not a repeat of the main effect |

Parts should add up to the zone forecast. This is an additive decomposition, not “poverty caused infections”. Do not use it automatically as a siting score.

### 4) `website/rolling_alpha.csv` (graph weights for ten versions)

**One row:** one U0x.  
**Use:** a small chart of how the three graph weights change across updates.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `update_id` | U01–U10 |
| `update_date` | Date this version starts |
| `forecast_start` / `forecast_end` | Issue-date range this version covers in the labelled test |
| `alpha_geo` / `alpha_transport` / `alpha_mobility` | Three graph weights, sum to 1 |
| `selected_epoch` | Training epoch that was selected (internal) |
| `training_window_days` | Each update fits on the past 730 days |
| `checkpoint_checksum` | Hash of the weight file |

### 5) `website/date_selector.csv`

Website date menu: the 264 retrospective issue dates only.  
Do **not** add train or validation dates. Do **not** mix 4 March into the same ordinary menu (label it separately as unverified).

### 6) `website/edinburgh_iz_boundaries.geojson`

111 zone polygons, web CRS **EPSG:4326** (longitude/latitude). Join to forecasts on `iz_code`.

### 7) `website/model_metadata.json`

Footer text for the website: forecast definition, graph meanings, calibration, explanation limits.

## 4. Paper tables (`article/`)

Numbers in `article/` are rounded for Word. The same tables at full precision are in `article/full_precision/`.

### table01 How the data are split

Time is cut earliest to latest: train → validation (half to pick the training epoch, half to calibrate uncertainty) → test.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `split_name` | Which slice |
| `fraction` | Share of all target days |
| `target_start_date` / `target_end_date` | Target-day range |
| `n_unique_target_dates` | Number of distinct target days |
| `n_valid_iz_date_cells` | Zone × day cells (about 111 × days) |
| `mean_infection_rate` | Mean rate in this slice |
| `std_infection_rate` | How spread out the rate is |
| `mean_target_delta` | Average 7-day change |
| `std_target_delta` | How spread out the change is |

Test slice: 2022-06-07 to 2023-02-25. That is the website date range and the accuracy tables.

### table02 Which method is more accurate (full test)

Three rows: persistence (“assume no change”), fixed model (trained once), rolling model (U01–U10, the main result).

See MAE, skill, RMSE, R², bias above.  
Rolling MAE 46.53, about 8% better than persistence.

### table03 By epidemic period

The test period is split again:

- **Declining / wave period** 2022-06-07 to 2022-09-19  
- **Late stable period** from **2022-09-20** to 2023-02-25  
- **Overall**

Late-period MAE skill is negative: “assume no change” is often more stable then. Do not write that the model wins throughout.

### table04 How good is the uncertainty

Retrospective only.  
`raw_*` = interval from a Gaussian formula (comparison only).  
`calibrated_*` = interval after validation-period calibration (report these).

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `nominal_coverage` | The 80% or 95% we claim |
| `observed_coverage` | Share of truths actually inside the band (0 to 1) |
| `mean/median_interval_width` | How wide the band is |
| `mean_predicted_sigma` | Average uncertainty |
| `corr_sigma_absolute_error` | When σ is large, is the error also large? (about 0.63) |
| `gaussian_nll` | Probabilistic score; smaller is better |

### table05a / 05b Graph weights

- **05a:** each U01–U10’s own three alphas. Use 05a for a specific day.  
- **05b:** average and spread across ten updates. You may write “mixed, mobility slightly higher”. **Do not** use 05b to explain a single forecast day.

### table06 4 March explanation summary

One row per socio-economic variable, plus location.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mean_absolute_main_effect` | Average strength of the main effect (ignoring sign) |
| `mean_signed_main_effect` | Average push up or down |
| `mean_absolute_location_interaction` | Extra location × variable strength; blank on the location row |
| `positive_effect_iz_fraction` | Share of 111 zones pushed up |
| `negative_effect_iz_fraction` | Share pushed down |

Example: income deprivation pushes about half of zones up and half down, so do not write that it raises risk city-wide.

## 5. What the webpage should show collaborators

1. Pick a date (264 retrospective days; 4 March labelled “no published value yet”).  
2. Map: predicted rate; on retrospective days also observed and error; **every day** can show uncertainty σ.  
3. Click a zone: forecast, truth if any, interval, which U0x, three alphas.  
4. On 4 March only: explanations (map one component, or a waterfall for that zone).  
5. A small chart of alpha from U01 to U10.  
6. Keep accuracy and split tables under Methods, not in front of the map.

Vaccination siting is not built yet. If it is added, use predicted rate and σ as the risk layer; keep GeoShapley as a human-readable note, not an automatic siting score. Candidate sites and travel times are still missing.

---

## 6. Please do not

1. Score “how accurate is U10?” using 4 March — that day has no ground truth.  
2. Average the ten alphas and treat the mean as that day’s graph contribution.  
3. Write “alpha = 0.36 means mobility caused 36% of infections”.  
4. Show 4 March or fixed-split GeoShapley on a rolling retrospective date.  
5. Edit `data/raw`, or overwrite the saved rolling checkpoints.
